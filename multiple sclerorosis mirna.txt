MiR-155 is a miRNA that is necessary for normal immune function. MiR-155 was reported to significantly decrease the production of mature B-cells in lymph node germinal centers in mice. Immunoglobulin M (IgM), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels also significantly decreased after antigen stimulation [16], [17]. Studies have shown that miR-150 is involved in regulating expression of the transcription factor c-Myb, which regulates B-cell development. In vivo, a decrease in c-Myb expression resulted in a decrease in B-cell maturation [18], [19]. MiRNA dysfunction was also shown to be involved in the pathology of MS. For example, miR-29b was highly expressed in memory CD4+ T-cells in MS patients, with lower expression in activated T-cells. miR-29 was suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of MS as a regulator of Th1 cells and suggested to cause chronic inflammation through an imbalance of feedback regulation [20]. Lorenzi et al. reported that miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression was low in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with MS, and these miRNAs were mainly concentrated in CD4+ T-cells, the target gene of which is B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), which inhibits or delays apoptosis. Bcl-2 was highly expressed in CD4+ T-cells in MS patients, the levels of which negatively correlated with miR-15a/16-1. Therefore, miR-15a/16-1 may participate in the pathogenesis of MS by inhibiting the apoptotic pathway of inflammatory cells [21].

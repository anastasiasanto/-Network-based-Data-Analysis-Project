Studying the effect of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) on Kainate  receptor Ionotropic activity in Multiple Sclerosis  patients. aa.2023-2024

 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling
 neurological disease of young adults with symptom onset
 generally occurring between the ages of 20 to 40 years.
 It is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease that attacks
 myelinated axons in the central nervous system (white matter),
 destroying the myelin and the axon in variable degrees and
 producing significant physical disability within 20–25 years
 in more than 30% of patients. 
 Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an oral drug approved for
 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS); it is an anti inflammatory/immunomodulatory drug that acts by triggering
 activation of the Nrf-2 pathway, a natural defense mecha
nism against inflammation and oxidative stress, and leads to
 reduction of neurofilament light (NFL) [3]. Since its precise
 mechanism of action is still not entirely clear, we decided to
 delve into other possible targets of the drug.
  In this paper we analyse a dataset from the study ”Circulating microRNAs in relapsing MS patients treated with dimethyl fumarate in the phase 4 TREMEND trial”
